# PWRLEAK
PWRLEAK is a work to show that AMD SEV (not SEV-ES/SEV-SNP) is vulnerable to power side-channel attacks.

Due to the fact that AMD has not yet completed the vulnerability fix, only a portion of the code is currently publicly available in our repository. Some machine-related debugging data, as well as the code related to optimization effects and usability of this work, will be made available in the future.
