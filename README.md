# PWRLEAK
PWRLEAK is a work to show that AMD SEV (not SEV-ES/SEV-SNP) is vulnerable to power side-channel attacks. The related paper can be found at: (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-35504-2_3)

The acknowledgement from AMD can be found atï¼š https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-3004.html

Due to the fact that AMD has not yet completed the vulnerability fix, we leave some machine-related optimization and debugging data and code behind.

Two folders are related to emulation and interrupt based interpolators. Please refer to each folder for details.
