# How to use

Please measure the power change during the computation, and put them in `traces.csv` with each line a trace.
A trace consists the power samples of each multiplication in this particular RSA computation.
This process gives the RSA key of the computation (assuming we know the first bit as 0).

# Note

The noise of the measurement is relatively high compared to those direct measurement.
A denoise method applies to our process is needed.
